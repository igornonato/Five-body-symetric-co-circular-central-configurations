# Five-body-symetric-co-circular-central-configurations

The files provided here are the .mw files created using the Maple software for the computations performed in the article \textit{Five Body Symmetric Co-Circular Central Configurations}. Each file corresponds to a specific calculation. For example, the file section6 - 6.1 - theorem 6.3 (A1).mw describes the computation for region A_1 of Theorem 6.3 in subsection 6.1. In the article, each instance where symbolic computation was required explicitly references the corresponding file used.
